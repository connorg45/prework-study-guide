# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description


I was motivated to work on this project because this project was my first time using git and github the whole way through. I built this project to help me learn and remember the basics. This project is useful to refer back to because of the information that it covers. I learnt how to use some javascript and get familiar with git and github.

## Usage


This project can be used to help new webdevelopers get some important basics down and also reference it in the future. There are sections on the webiste that have some notes on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and also Git. Another cool feature from this project is that if you open the DevTools console you can see Javascript running.
